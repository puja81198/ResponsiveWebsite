          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education in India is primarily managed by state-run public education system, 
              which fall under the command of the government at three levels: federal, state and local. 
              Under various articles of the Indian Constitution and the Right of Children to Free and Compulsory Education Act, 2009, free and compulsory education is provided as a fundamental right to children aged 6 to 14. 
              The approximate ratio of public schools to private schools in India is 7:5. Major policy initiatives in Indian education are numerous. 
              Up until 1976, education policies and implementation were determined legally by each of India’s constitutional states. The 42nd amendment to the constitution in 1976 made education a ‘concurrent subject’. 
              From this point on the central and state governments shared formal responsibility for funding and administration of education</p>

                    <p class="sectionSubTag text-small"> The articles in English are the definite article the and the indefinite articles a and an. The definite article is used when the speaker believes that the listener knows the identity of the noun's referent 
                        (because it is obvious, because it is common knowledge, or because it was mentioned in the same sentence or an earlier sentence). The indefinite article is used when the 
                         the listener does not have to be told the identity of the referent. No article is used in some noun phrases.   </div>
